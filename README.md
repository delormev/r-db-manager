# Postgres connection manager for R

## rpgmanager package

This package aims to simplify the way you can connect to Postgres databases by using a system of aliases. After the user has set up a list of aliases corresponding to a set of hostname / port / database / username, this package lets you easily connect to and run queries against that database using the aliases.
For now, it relies on the passwords stored in .pgpass, so you must be using that as well. 

## Example

After setting up your dg.conf like so:

```
#alias:hostname:port:database:user
database1:my.postgres.db.com:5432:my_database1:user1

```

... and your .pgpass like this:
```
#hostname:port:database:username:password
my.postgres.db.com:5432:my_database:user1:my_password
```

You can easily run queries against `database1` in R as shown below:
```R
# Load package
library(rpgmanager)

# Create connection using the alias
db1 <- newConnection("database1")

# Run a text query against database1
res1 <- runQuery(db1, query = "SELECT * FROM users;")

# Run a query from a file against database1
res2 <- runQuery(db1, userFile = TRUE, queryLocation = "~/query2.sql")

# Free up resources taken by the connection
destroyConnection(db1)
```

## Motivation

This R package is for people who run a lot of queries against a lot of different databases. 
This setup lets you easily connect to different databases by using db.conf, a file listing 
connection details (sets of hostname / port / database / username) matched to aliases.
It also lets you keep and manage your own library of SQL queries by taking input SQL files.

## Installation

### Easy install

Directly from R
```R
# Install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

#Â Install the package directly from github
devtools::install_github("delormev/r-pg-manager/rpgmanger")

```

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/delormev/r-pg-manager.git
R
```

And then in R
```R
install.packages("r-pg-manager/rpgmanager", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## Future improvements

* Output to CSV
* Interactive prompt for password when missing from .pgpass
